# popular-movies

"Popular Movies" project for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program.

The application presents the most popular and highest rated movies from "The Movie Database"'s API, as well as user's favorite movies collection, stored in a database using Room.

The application uses Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle), allows users to view and play trailers in the web browser, and to read reviews of a selected movie.

## Instructions for using API

The API key has been removed. 
Please request your own key from the **themoviedb.org** and insert it in the MainActivity.java file (**"String "apiKey")**.
